This is my new GitHub as the previous one was split between several developers I no longer work with. Here I post my old and new projects I have created for 7 years. I also try to learn new technologies and some examples will appear here.

I am interested in web development and know PHP programming language which helped me in my life since version 4. Also related knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript. Naturally for fast development I use modern frameworks like Laravel, a little Symfony and also pure PHP with MVC pattern. I understand frontend but I don't like it, mostly it's javascript, jquery, bootstrap. 

I am currently studying C#, which gives a wider range of projects that can be found on freelancing. I also intend to tighten up the frontend a bit in terms of VUE.js , React, I'm interested in working with Node.js.
